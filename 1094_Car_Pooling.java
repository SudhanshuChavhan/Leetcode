/*
1094. Car Pooling

There is a car with capacity empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer capacity and an array trips where trip[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi] indicates that the ith trip has numPassengersi passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are fromi and toi respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return true if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
 
Constraints:
1 <= trips.length <= 1000
trips[i].length == 3
1 <= numPassengersi <= 100
0 <= fromi < toi <= 1000
1 <= capacity <= 105

class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        // Because from and to is between 0 and 1000. Idea is to store counts in an array of size 1001.

        for (int trip[] : trips){
            lengthOfTrip[trip[1]] += trip[0]; // Increment when passenger is on board
            lengthOfTrip[trip[2]] -= trip[0]; // decrement when they depart
        }
		// Count total passenger for each bus top
        int carLoad = 0;
        // we have the count array, we perform a line sweep from 0 to 1000 and track its total
        for (int i = 0; i < 1001 && carLoad <= capacity; i++){
            carLoad += lengthOfTrip[i];
			// Reject when the car is overloaded somewhere
            if(carLoad > capacity) return false;
        }

        return true; // Accept only if all trip is safe
    }
